                <h1>StudentLife Web App</h1>
                <p>
                    Project from Fall 2025 CS-3203 Software Engineering course

                    StudentLife prototype was designed to be a productivity app for students to organize assignments, homework, and exams. 
                    Features included a calendar, AI study assistant, and campus events.
                    <br> <br>
                    StudentLife was created in React Native using the Expo framework. Originally designed to work on Android and iOS devices, 
                    the final demonstrated prototype worked best in the form of a web app. Microsoft Azure Services were used to store and update user data, as well as hosting the AI assitant.
                    My personal contributions to the project mainly included setup of React Native and Expo development environments for my, and my group members' machines; front-end programming; UI design; and functionality/security testing.

                    A good exercise in using FFT and spectrum analysis.
